This was a project in my first year of my Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.
The task was to create a calculator with 10 functions

There are 3 files
1. API_calculator.py contains all the code to obtain user in-put
2. calculatorCA.py has the code to carry out the 10 functions
3. calculator_testCA.py is unit test code to check that everything functions as required


Reviewing it now a year later, if I ever had the time I would:
(i) update the functions to avoid 'continue' and 'break' etc where possible
(ii) refactor the '#Body of Code to Operate the Calculator' code in the API_calculator.py into functions
